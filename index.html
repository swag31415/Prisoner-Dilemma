            <h1>Prisoner's Dilemma Tournament</h1>
        </header>
        <h2>Objective:</h2>

        <p>Design a Python program that competes in a 100-round Prisoner's Dilemma tournament against programs submitted
            by other students. The program with the most wins across all matches is the champion.</p>

        <h2>Rules:</h2>

        <ul>
            <li><b>Choices:</b> In each round, your program must return either:
                <ul>
                    <li>"we good" (Cooperate)</li>
                    <li>"throwing hands" (Defect)</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><b>Payoff:</b>
                <ul>
                    <li>Both "we good": 1 point each</li>
                    <li>One "we good", one "throwing hands": 2 points for defector, 0 for cooperator</li>
                    <li>Both "throwing hands": 0 points each</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><b>Rounds:</b> 100 consecutive rounds per match</li>
            <li><b>Information:</b> Your program receives the full history of both its own and its opponent's choices
                from previous rounds.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Technical Requirements:</h2>

        <ul>
            <li><b>Language:</b> Python 3</li>
            <li><b>Libraries:</b> No external libraries allowed (use standard Python features only)</li>
            <li><b>Submission:</b> Submit your Python function on the google form linked below</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Example Program:</h2>
        <pre class="code-block"><code class="language-python"># It is essential that your function is called main
def main(yourPastPlays, yourOpsPastPlays):
    Y = "we good"
    N = "throwing hands"
    if len(yourPastPlays) == 0 or yourOpsPastPlays[-1] != N:
        return Y # Cooperate initially or if opponent didn't defect
    return N # Defect if opponent defected last round (tit-for-tat)</code></pre>

        <h2>Evaluation:</h2>

        <p>You code will appear immediately on this page. After a few moments you should also see it's evaluation in the tournament.</p>

        <h2>Strategy Tips:</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>The Prisoner's Dilemma explores concepts of trust, cooperation, and betrayal.</li>
            <li>Consider different strategies, such as tit-for-tat, always cooperating, always defecting, random choice,
                or more complex approaches based on the history of plays.</li>
        </ul>

        <b>Get Creative! This is your chance to outsmart your classmates and design a winning strategy. Good luck!</b>
